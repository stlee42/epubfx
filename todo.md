## Bugs 
- metadata editor is not working (epub2 and epub3)
- if file is open and will be renamed, preview is not updated and tries to use the file with the old name
- when image is renamed, usages in xhtml is not updated
- sometimes selection of text with mouse is not possible

## Improvements
- make spell check faster without flickering 
- search over more than one file
- if a template is used, ask user for author, title and some other basic metadata
